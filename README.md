Discuss Pros and Cons with manual versus automated tests

Manual:
+ More flexible than automated tests.
+ Shorter startup period.
+ Can be used as exploratory testing.
- Effeciency issues. 
- More time consuming.
- For large systems it can require a full integration test, in order to test a single component.
- Human error.

Automated:
+ Efficient maintainability.
+ Easy to unit test small/specific components of code.
+ Faster response to new code implementations.
- High overhead cost, depending on testing framework.
